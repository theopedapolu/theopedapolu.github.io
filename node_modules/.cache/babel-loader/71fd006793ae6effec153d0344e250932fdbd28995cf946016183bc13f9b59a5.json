Due to\n            the lack of a clear timeline, the reader develops a affinity for the\n            characters rather than the plot. Heller takes the time to give us the\n            backstories for most characters and develops their manner of speech,\n            thinking patterns, and actions in a way that they become familiar to us. We\n            find ourselves understanding why they say or do certain things, even if we\n            don't agree with them. and As I will explain later in my analysis, this\n            intimate perspective from each character is a crucial theme in the book.\n        </p>\n        <h3 id=\"themes\">Themes</h3>\n        <h4 id=\"bureaucracy\">Bureaucracy</h4>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Indifference</li>\n            <li>People (Powerful &amp; Powerless)</li>\n        </ul>\n        <h4 id=\"fear-morality\">Fear &amp; Morality</h4>\n        <h4 id=\"anchored-hope-hope-through-evidence-\">\n            Anchored Hope (Hope through Evidence)\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n            Sources:\n            <a href=\"https://weneedtotalkaboutbooks.com/2020/06/11/catch-22-by-joseph-heller-a-review/\">\n            https://weneedtotalkaboutbooks.com/2020/06/11/catch-22-by-joseph-heller-a-review/\n            </a>\n        </p>\n    </>\n\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Catch_22;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,iBAAiB;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAAA,SAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AAEzB,SAASC,QAAQA,CAAA,EAAG;EAChB,oBACCH,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBACGJ,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;IAEJ;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,gXAMa,EAAC,GAAG;IAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACjB,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;MAAIS,EAAE,EAAC,yBAAyB;MAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;IAAuB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7DR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,qiBAQkC,EAAC,GAAG;IAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACtC,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,gBACe,eAAAJ,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAQ;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,qGAC0B,eAAAR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAQ;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,EAAC,GAAG,EAAC,+5BAanB,EAAC,GAAG,eAChER,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAQ;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,wJAEI,EAAC,GAAG;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAC1B,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,qPAIqB,eAAAJ,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAQ;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,4GAC4B,EAAC,GAAG;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACtE,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,gBACIJ,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAsD;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/DR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAA2C;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACpD,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,2PAI0B,eAAAJ,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAQ;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,gRAIvB,EAAC,GAAG,eACvBR,OAAA;QAAGU,IAAI,EAAC,+GAA+G;QAAAN,QAAA,EAAC;MAExH;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,gOAGgE,EAAC,GAAG;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACzE,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;MAAIS,EAAE,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;IAAc;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3CR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,68BAcO,EAAC,GAAG;IAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACX,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,u0BAY0B,EAAC,GAAG;IAAA;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAC9B,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;IASH;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;MAAIS,EAAE,EAAC,QAAQ;MAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;IAAM;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC3BR,OAAA;MAAIS,EAAE,EAAC,aAAa;MAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;IAAW;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrCR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,gBACIJ,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAY;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrBR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAAiC;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAC1C,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;MAAIS,EAAE,EAAC,eAAe;MAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;IAAmB;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/CR,OAAA;MAAIS,EAAE,EAAC,sCAAsC;MAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;IAE9C;MAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;MAAAI,QAAA,GAAG,UAEC,eAAAJ,OAAA;QAAGU,IAAI,EAAC,mFAAmF;QAAAN,QAAA,EAAC;MAE5F;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACL,CAAC;EAAA,eACN,CAAC;AAGP;AAACG,EAAA,GApIQR,QAAQ;AAsIjB,eAAeA,QAAQ;AAAC,IAAAQ,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
