# **About Me**

Hi, my name is Theophilus Pedapolu :wave:<br>
I graduated with a bachelor's in computer science and applied math from UC Berkeley. I am interested in deep learning, full stack software development, computer vision, and computer security. I also dabble in some math on the side, namely number theory and analysis, which I studied in my undergrad and find interesting to learn. In my free time, I like to play chess online (rated ~2000), read mystery novels, and jam on my guitar or piano. Hit up me for a game on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/starshopper22) if you ever want to play.
