            My Review of Catch-22 by Joseph Heller

            I recently finished reading Catch-22 and I have to say, it's probably my
            favorite book of all time. Though initially hesitant to read it at first
            since I don't really find war novels that appealing, I loved Catch-22 all
            the way through. It's the perfect mixture of humor, existentially,
            solemnity, and adventure, and I found it quite relatable to my own
            experiences.{" "}

        <h3 id="what-is-catch-22-about-">What is Catch-22 About?</h3>
        <p>
            Catch-22 is a satirical war novel set in the island of Pianosa, Italy during
            World War II. It follows the protagonist, Captain John Yossarian, and
            various personnel in the 256th US Army Air Squadron as they navigate the
            paradoxical nature of military bureaucracy. The singular goal for most
            airmen in Yossarian's squadron is to finish flying the required number of
            missions and go home. But this never happens as their commanding officer,
            Colonel Cathcart, keeps increasing the number of missions they have to fly
            in the name of personal ambition.{" "}
        </p>

            The idea of a <em>Catch-22</em> is central to the story and pops up in
            almost every chapter and character interaction. Today, a <em>Catch-22</em>{" "}
            often represents any paradoxical situation, particularly where existing
            illogical rules make it impossible to escape. However, in the book, a
            Catch-22 is a real military rule that essentially says that if you're
            terrified of flying more missions, you are thinking rationally and hence
            you're not crazy. If you're crazy, you can be grounded from flying more
            missions on the basis on mental insanity. But the moment you ask to be
            grounded, you're thinking rationally so you're not crazy. See the
            paradoxical loop there? As the novel progresses, and you read more and more
            gruesome scenes about airmen getting hit with enemy flak, planes being
            destroyed in midair, and the harrowing fear of death Yossarian and his
            squadron have every time they go on a new mission, it becomes clear that the
            only people that can continue flying without losing their mind are the ones
            that are already insane. Of course, due to the cleverness of{" "}
            <em>Catch-22</em>, there's no way to get around this. Once you've gone
            crazy, you don't care about your life anymore so you'll keep flying more
            missions voluntarily.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
            I must admit, when I first read about the Catch-22 rule, I thought it was
            just another satirical joke by Heller, absurd and ironic. But, the more I
            thought about it, the more I realized it represents a great deal more than
            that. The genius of <em>Catch-22</em> lay in the fact that it makes perfect
            sense when taken at face value. The two rules it consists of are:{" "}
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Being concerned for your safety means you're not crazy</li>
            <li>If you're crazy, you can ask to be grounded</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Taken separately, both rules make logical sense, but when put together you
            get a contradiction. It's a devilishly clever way of forcing airmen to keep
            flying missions. Those in positions of authority can effectively conceal
            their abuse of power via <em>Catch-22</em> because neither rule can be
            called out as wrong or illogical. Of course, this is all a contrived
            fictional example, but how many times do we encounter Catch-22s in our own
            lives? At the DMV, filing taxes, or applying to jobs? (Here a Reddit thread
            with more examples:{" "}
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3zvvh5/what_is_a_catch_22_you_have_experienced_in_real/?rdt=58408">

            </a>
            ) Any sufficiently large bureaucracy is bound have logical contradictions in
            the form of Catch-22s. It's an inescapable part of life, and Heller points
            out just how absurd they can get when paired with human selfishness.{" "}
        </p>
        <h3 id="book-structure">Book Structure</h3>
        <p>
            Catch-22 is a very nonlinear book, chronologically speaking, as the chapters
            weave in and out through different events with no clear passage of time.
            Each chapter feels like its own episode, but as the book progresses, you
            start to form the outline of the whole story in your head. The number of
            missions flown, major events (such as the Battle of Bologna or the Mission
            over Avignon), and morbidly, the airmen still alive in the squadron serve as
            contextual anchors that give the reader an idea of the timing of each
            chapter. Heller accomplishes a remarkable feat, in my opinion. He chooses
            when to reveal each event and how much to reveal so carefully that it feels
            like the reader is putting together puzzle pieces in their head, and the
            more they read, the more the picture becomes complete. This is also one of
            the reasons why some people give up reading after the first few chapters.
            It's hard to see the value when you only have a few disconnected pieces at
            first.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
            The writing style, as mentioned earlier, is ironic and quite humorous.
            Nearly every chapter contains some dialogue or action that's so absurd it
            makes you burst out laughing (my favorites were Yossarian pretending to be a
            dying soldier and Colonel Cathcart's introduction). This is harder to do
            than one might imagine when you consider that the placement of words, their
            intensity/specificity, and how much they reveal can make or break the humor
            in a sentence. Although the humor is what keeps the reader entertained
            through the book, it is also a way for Heller to highlight the inhumane
            nature of the military system Yossarian's squadron is subjected to. Most of
            these "funny" situations arise from bureaucratic errors or contradictions
            and there is often a sense of injustice that underlies them and grows
            stronger towards the end.{" "}

            Lastly, I want to mention the importance of characters in the book. Due to
            the lack of a clear timeline, the reader develops a affinity for the
            characters rather than the plot. Heller takes the time to give us the
            backstories for most characters and develops their manner of speech,
            thinking patterns, and actions in a way that they become familiar to us. We
            find ourselves understanding why they say or do certain things, even if we
            don't agree with them. and As I will explain later in my analysis, this
            intimate perspective from each character is a crucial theme in the book.
